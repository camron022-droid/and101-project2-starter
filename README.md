# AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: **Cameron Smith**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Kotlin Debug-a-thon App** is an Android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs. With those fixed, it now includes a collection of mini activities/widgets such as Hello World, Number Sum, Current Day, Random Color, Print List, and Favorite Number—all fully functional! The app demonstrates core Kotlin debugging skills and interactive UI handling.  

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **🐿️🛠️🎨**

## Notes

During this project, I learned a lot about common Kotlin pitfalls, such as **class cast exceptions, null pointer exceptions, and type casting issues**. I also improved my debugging workflow in Android Studio, learned how to properly initialize and access UI elements, and became more confident handling user interactions, text updates, and dynamic UI changes. Fixing these bugs reinforced the importance of understanding Kotlin’s type system and safe handling of nullable types.
